This was quite tricky for a beginer like myself, I found the first part of the tutorial really helpful, however the second part focusing on localStorage gave me moment to pause, having to use some nonexistent intuition. Thanks to [github.com/hariramjp777](github.com/hariramjp777) for providing the tutorial, I found this UI to be more intersting than most other starter projects.
